\chapter{Implementation}

We implemented our simulation of Puerto Rico using python3 and a variety of standard libraries, such as OS, math, sys, and random.  Non-standard libraries include Pickle and Enum.  Pickle was used for serialization while Enum was used for some more readable type information... enum was included in the project for Opp lab issue reasons, but pickle might still need to be installed on the user's computer in order to run this project. \\

The GA is based on one written for Homework 2 of the course, while the ANN is a translation of Dr. Pyeatt's code from C++.  Future versions of the code may use Numpy to speed things up, or perhaps implement Cython for improved performace.  The GA is meant to be run ahead of time, and the main game runs more than fast enough for end user purposes.
