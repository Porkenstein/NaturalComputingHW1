\chapter{Introduction}

This project was an idea of Derek's, who then conscripted Chris into helping.  Eurogames are a beloved hobby of his, and Puerto Rico is a classic example.  Eurogames are a perfect application of optimization techniques, as they are imprecise and difficult to determine optimal movesets for.  An EA was chosen for optimization due to the imprecision, and an ANN was chosen for the difficult moveset determination.  Since it cannot be flatly determined how well an AI is doing at any particular step of the game, active training was thrown out as an option, and instead the weights are evolved via touranment selection, where 3-ai games are quickly played to determine which weightset is superior - although luck does play a large part in it as well, increasing the difficulty of the whole premise.
