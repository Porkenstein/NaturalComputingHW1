\chapter{Problem}

The board game Puerto Rico is a beloved Euro game of critical acclaim and widespread popularity.  It involves indirect player interaction through the building of a Caribbean island colony, where the players compete for money and victory points via exports and sales of their cash crops. Puerto Rico is simple to learn but hard to master because of all the decision making the player has to do throughout the game.  This means that the actions, while simple to represent, are very difficult to pick in different situations... making the choices of actions perfect for one of the techniques discussed in class.  Our goal is to develop an AI capable of playing puerto rico with a human with 3 players.
