\section{The Main }

main.py is the file which is run to play the game with AIs and human players.  It wraps together the AI controller, file I/O, ANNs and the game code together into one cohesive simulation of Puerto Rico meant to be exposed to the end user.

\subsection{Usage}

\begin{quote}

python3 main.py

\end{quote} 

Main asks for the number of players and the filename of each AI.  It is reccomended that 2 players and 1 AI are chosen at this point, and the AI file to enter is "ai.pickle".

\subsection{Starting the Game}

After the number of players is entered and the filename is entered, Pickle loads the binary file - created before submission - and unpacks the weights into a variable which is passed into a new AI.
The game loop ends when a winner is found.
